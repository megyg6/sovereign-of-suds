## An analysis of the most reviewed beers on Beer Advocate (A community deidcated to the support and promotion of beer)
Capstone Project for Cohort DA10 at Nashville Software School 

### Motivation and Description:
This project was motivated by wanting to build a project that advanced web scraping, data cleaning, EDA, insight gathering, and visualization knowledge and skills. The project is designed to help anybody ordering at a brewery or bar by providing a better insight into top-reviewed beers from BeerAdvocate (https://www.beeradvocate.com/). This would help individuals who find all the options overwhelming, decide where to start.
